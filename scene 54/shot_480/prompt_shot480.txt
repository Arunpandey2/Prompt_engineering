A medium shot of Bryan Starbucks, a charismatic man in his 40s standing at 5'8" tall. His face features a well-groomed mustache and beard framing a strong jawline, with medium-length, neatly styled brown hair parted slightly off-center. His striking blue eyes and fair skin tone with a healthy glow complement his professional appearance. Bryan stands confidently in the middle of a park, wearing a tailored navy blazer over a crisp white shirt, paired with dark denim jeans. His polished brown leather loafers and accessories - a sleek silver watch and stylish sunglasses resting on his head - complete his smart-casual ensemble.
