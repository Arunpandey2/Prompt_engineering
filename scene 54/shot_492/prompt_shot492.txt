A medium shot of a family of three aliens walking behind Kevin (details: A 35-year-old Black man, 5'9", lean and muscular, sharp and professional with composed confidence, short neatly styled black hair, well-groomed goatee, focused dark brown eyes, smooth deep brown skin, polished and practical attire in earth tones) on E Woodin Ave. The father alien stands 5'8", the mother 5'4", and the child 3' tall. They are walking closer to the left side of the screen, with the father and child aliens briefly turning their heads towards Kevin and smiling. The child's glance is slightly out of sync, occurring 0.5 seconds before or after the father's. Kevin's head and upper torso rotate slightly to the right as he waves with his right hand, lifting it to mid-chest level. The entire interaction lasts 2 seconds or less.
