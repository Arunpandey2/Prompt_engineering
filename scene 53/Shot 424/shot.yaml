  his 40s, stands at 5'8'' with a well-groomed mustache and beard framing his
  strong jawline. His medium-length brown hair, styled with a slight wave,
  complements his striking blue eyes and fair skin, which glows with health.

  occasional footsteps, and the murmur of people create a lively urban
  atmosphere. The scene is devoid of vehicles, allowing the focus to remain on

  and city sounds, complemented by the foley of footsteps on pavement, adding to
  the realism of the setting. As Bryan and Kevin continue their walk, the camera
