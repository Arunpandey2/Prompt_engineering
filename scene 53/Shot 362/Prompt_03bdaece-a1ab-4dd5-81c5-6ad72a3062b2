A dynamic aerial shot that begins high above Lake Chelan, smoothly moving eastward toward Chelan City. The camera gradually descends, following a natural path that leads to E Woodin Ave. The scene transitions from a wide, panoramic view of the lake to a more focused perspective of the downtown area. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day, with the sun casting long shadows that add depth to the landscape. The composition maintains a balanced frame throughout the movement, with the lake's sparkling water giving way to the city's architecture. The camera movement is smooth and cinematic, creating a sense of journey and discovery.
