  Front camera, medium shot with Bryan centered and standing still in a minimal,
  softly lit scene representing 1% progress on Path A, no one else visible until
  Victor slowly walks toward the camera before speaking, creating a calm,
  cinematic atmosphere with muted colors, slight depth of field, and a cozy,
  introspective tone.
