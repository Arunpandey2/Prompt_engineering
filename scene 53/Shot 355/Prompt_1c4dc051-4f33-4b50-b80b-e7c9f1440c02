A medium close-up shot of Bryan (Bryan Starbuck is a man in his 40s, 5'8'' tall, with a charismatic presence. His face features a well-groomed mustache and beard, framing a strong jawline. He has medium-length, neatly styled brown hair with a slight wave, parted slightly off-center. His eyes are a striking blue, and his skin tone is fair with a healthy, natural glow. His voice is smooth, confident, warm, with a subtle gravelly undertone.) standing center frame on a downtown Chelan street. The shot captures him from the front, with a clean, modern storefront visible in the background. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day, casting soft shadows that add depth to the scene. Bryan's expression is engaging and professional, his body language confident yet approachable. The composition places him slightly off-center, following the rule of thirds, with the storefront providing context without overwhelming the frame.
