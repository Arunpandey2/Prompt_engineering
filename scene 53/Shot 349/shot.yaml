  In a vibrant park filled with the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant
  chatter of park visitors, Bryan Starbucks, a charismatic and confident CEO,
  stands at the center of the scene. The setting is alive with the vibrant
  colors of quaint shops and cafes that line E Woodin Ave, all bathed in the
  soft, natural daylight that casts warm shadows and highlights the welcoming
  atmosphere. The camera captures Bryan in a medium shot, eye-level, and
  centered, focusing intently on his dialogue and expressions. The camera
  remains static, ensuring that the audience's attention is drawn to Bryan's
  confident presence and the important message he conveys.


  Bryan, a man in his 40s with a striking appearance, stands confidently facing
  the camera. His well-groomed mustache and beard frame a strong jawline, and
  his medium-length, neatly styled brown hair with a slight wave is parted

  fills the scene. He addresses the unseen audience with a serious tone,
  explaining video length customization and emphasizing that not everyone needs
  to focus on the advanced parts of the product. His words are clear and
  informative, inviting two people to introduce themselves, though they remain
  off-camera. The scene is devoid of any camera movement, allowing Bryan's
  confident demeanor and the natural beauty of the park to take center stage.


  The ambient sounds of the park, including the gentle rustling of leaves and
  distant chatter, enhance the realism of the setting, creating an engaging and
  immersive experience. The lighting is even, with a slight warm tone that
  enhances the welcoming atmosphere, making the scene feel both realistic and
  inviting. No subtitles.
