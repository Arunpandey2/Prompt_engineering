  Front camera, medium shot with Bryan centered and standing still alone in a
  softly lit, minimal scene representing 1% progress on Path A, as Victor
  quietly steps back to stand beside Kevin off-screen, followed by Kevin taking
  a few calm steps forward toward where Victor originally stood, maintaining a
  gentle, cinematic rhythm with muted colors and cozy atmosphere.
