title: Bryan Intro Sets 1st In Stores Downtown
overViewForAI: >-
  Path A, 1%. Camera: Front. Medium Shot. Bryan (Left), Kevin (Right).  The
  background is now the shops on the north side of the street.  Before we were
  looking down the street.  Now the camera is on the south side of the street
  looking north. As Bryan speaks below, he will walk to catch up to Kevin. 
  Kevin doesn't move until Bryan has caught up with him. Then they are both
  walking down the center of the street east.  The camera will be on the south
  side.  In front and to the right of the men (from their direction).  The
  camera will be on the south side of the street pointing North-West, so it is
  looking back. It will "track to" Bryan, locked ahead and to the right of
  Bryan.  When Bryan catches up to Kevin, then they are walking side-by-side,
  talking, and the camera follows.

  Front camera, medium shot with Bryan on the left and Kevin on the right in
  front of shops lining the north side of the street, with the camera positioned
  on the south side looking north; Bryan walks to catch up to stationary Kevin,
  then both walk side-by-side east down the center of the street as the camera,
  located ahead and to their right on the south side, points northwest tracking
  Bryan smoothly to capture their conversation in a softly lit, natural urban
  scene with muted tones and comfortable, cinematic movement.
