A dynamic tracking shot that begins with a medium shot of Bryan (Bryan Starbuck is a man in his 40s, 5'8'' tall, with a charismatic presence. His face features a well-groomed mustache and beard, framing a strong jawline. He has medium-length, neatly styled brown hair with a slight wave, parted slightly off-center. His eyes are a striking blue, and his skin tone is fair with a healthy, natural glow. His voice is smooth, confident, warm, with a subtle gravelly undertone.) and Kevin (A 35-year-old Black man with a lean, muscular frame and a broad forehead. Standing at 5'9", he features short, neatly styled hair and a well-groomed goatee. He exudes a sharp, professional presence, carrying himself with composed confidence and understated strength.) on a downtown Chelan street. Bryan stands on the left. Kevin stands on the right. The camera is positioned on the south side of the street, looking north at the shops lining the north side. As Bryan speaks, he walks to catch up to Kevin, who remains stationary until Bryan reaches him. Once together, they begin walking side-by-side east down the center of the street. The camera, positioned ahead and to their right on the south side, smoothly tracks their movement while pointing northwest, maintaining a consistent distance and angle. The scene is set against a clean, modern storefront background. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day, casting soft shadows that add depth to the scene. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the characters' movement creating a dynamic but balanced frame.

We bridge storytelling into the visuals to accomplish the goals in the movie or marketing video. Our product pairs with Blender. Most of our customers will never use Blender. We run Blender server-side, so customers that don't know Blender will never have it on their computer."
