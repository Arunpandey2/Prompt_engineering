  Front camera, medium shot with Kevin on the right as a family of three aliens
  (Dad 5'8", Mom 5'4", Child 3') appears 15 feet behind him walking closer to
  the left side of the screen, Dad and Child briefly turn heads and smile at
  Kevin—with the Child’s glance slightly out of sync by about 0.5 seconds—while
  Kevin subtly rotates his head and upper torso right and waves with his right
  hand lifted no higher than mid-chest within 2 seconds before the alien family
  walks off left closer to the camera, and Kevin turns back to face the camera
  to talk to Bryan, all in a softly lit, minimal scene conveying calm, natural
  interaction with muted tones and subtle depth.
