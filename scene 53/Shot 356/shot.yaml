  Medium cinematic shot of a cozy downtown Chelan street, showing storefronts
  with detailed signs, brick or wood facades, and clear window reflections. The
  scene is lit by warm afternoon sunlight casting soft, angled shadows onto the
  sidewalk. The camera is positioned at eye level, facing across or slightly
  down the sidewalk toward the entrance of a small-town store. Trees, lampposts,
  and street elements add realistic depth. No people, cars, or animals are
  present â€” the space is clean, calm, and ready for character interaction.
