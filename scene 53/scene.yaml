  title: EXT. LAKE Shalan - BROLL FLY OVER LAKE
  description: >-
    A B-roll shot begins over Lake Shalan, 800 feet high, 2 km west of Shalan
    city, looking east. The camera flies east toward the city, descending to E
    Woodin Ave, landing between N Columbia St and N Emerson St, primarily facing
    east. BRYAN (40s, vibrant and engaging, in relaxed business attire), VICTOR
    (VFX professional), and Kevin (Blender expert) stand on the street, shops
    lining both sides. A slide #1 (10% transparent, 90% opaque) floats across
    70% of the screen, displaying script visuals, easing down 2 seconds before
    the prior scene's dialogue fades. As the dialogue ends, slide #2 ("Script
    Editing - Final Draft Equivalent") takes its place, matching transparency.
