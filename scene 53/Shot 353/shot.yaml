  In a serene park setting, Bryan Starbucks, a charismatic and confident CEO,

  and cafes. The atmosphere is professional yet relaxed, with a focus on
  productivity and innovation. Bryan, a man in his 40s with a well-groomed
  mustache and beard, exudes authority and warmth as he engages in a
  conversation with a YouTuber about a product. His medium-length, neatly styled
  brown hair with a slight wave is parted slightly off-center, complementing his
  striking blue eyes and fair skin with a healthy, natural glow. Dressed in a

  at eye level for a medium shot, centering Bryan in the frame. The camera

  resonate clearly. Natural daylight bathes the scene, casting soft shadows and
  highlighting the vibrant colors of the park, with a slight warm tone enhancing
  the welcoming atmosphere.


  As Bryan speaks, his gestures are subtle yet expressive, conveying confidence
  and authority. The gentle rustling of leaves, distant chatter from park-goers,
  and occasional bird chirps create a soothing ambient soundscape, while the
  subtle sounds of clothing rustling accompany Bryan's movements. The scene
  transitions seamlessly with cuts in and out, maintaining a smooth flow that
  emphasizes the engaging dialogue and character interaction. No subtitles.
