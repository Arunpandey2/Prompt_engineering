A medium close-up shot of Kevin (A 35-year-old Black man with a lean, muscular frame and a broad forehead. Standing at 5'9", he features short, neatly styled hair and a well-groomed goatee. He exudes a sharp, professional presence, carrying himself with composed confidence and understated strength.) positioned on the right side of the frame. A family of three aliens (a 5'8" father, a 5'4" mother, and a 3' child) appears 15 feet away, walking closer to the left side of the screen. The father and child briefly turn their heads toward Kevin and smile, with the child's glance slightly out of sync by 0.5 seconds. Kevin subtly rotates his head and upper torso to the right and waves with his right hand, lifting it no higher than mid-chest. This interaction occurs within 2 seconds, after which the alien family walks off to the left, and Kevin turns back to face the camera. The scene is set against a clean, modern storefront background on a downtown Shalan street. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day, casting soft shadows that add depth.
