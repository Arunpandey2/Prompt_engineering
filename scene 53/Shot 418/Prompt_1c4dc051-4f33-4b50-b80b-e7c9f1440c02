A medium close-up shot of Kevin (A 35-year-old Black man with a lean, muscular frame and a broad forehead. Standing at 5’9”, he features short, neatly styled hair and a well-groomed goatee. He exudes a sharp, professional presence, carrying himself with composed confidence and understated strength.) positioned in the center of the frame. He maintains a composed posture, his expression attentive and engaged. The scene is set against a clean, modern storefront background on a downtown Shalan street. The lighting is bright and natural, typical of a sunny day, casting soft shadows that add depth. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with Kevin as the focal point.
