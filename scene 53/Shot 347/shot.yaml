  Aerial cinematic shot approaching the small lakeside town of Shalan,
  Washington, with the camera gently descending from above. The view captures
  rolling green hills, rooftops of quaint downtown buildings, tree-lined
  streets, and the shimmering edge of Lake Shalan. The camera glides downward in
  a natural arc, slowly lowering toward street level, evoking arrival into the
  peaceful town. Lighting is bright and realistic, set in soft afternoon
  sunlight with clear shadows and light haze for depth. No people or animals are
  visible.
